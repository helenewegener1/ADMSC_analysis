We are working with adipose derived stromal cells (AD-MSCs) which are mesenchymal cells from the adult human adipose tissue. The initial cell population obtained from the digestion of the adipose tissue is called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and it contains several cell types like endothelial cells, pericytes, hematopoietic cells and, of course, AD-MSCs. In vitro expansion by serial passaging of the SVF fraction leads to AD-MSCs enrichment by cell adherence.
