We are working with adipose derived stromal cells (AD-MSCs) which are mesenchymal cells from the adult human adipose tissue. The initial cell population obtained from the digestion of the adipose tissue is called stromal vascular fraction (SVF) and it contains several cell types like endothelial cells, pericytes, hematopoietic cells and, of course, AD-MSCs. In vitro expansion by serial passaging of the SVF fraction leads to AD-MSCs enrichment by cell adherence.

Workflow: 

There is meant to be a data file on the same level as the github repo: 
- project/ADMSC_analysis
- project/data

00_data: FASTA and GTF transcriptome is downloaded and FASTA file is filtered according to GTF file. 
01_fastQC: FastQC on raw fastq files. (multiQC is run in 06_bulkAnalysis/01_GeneralOverviewAnalysis/01_QualityControl)
02_kallisto_index: kallisto index is build from FASTA file (un-filtered and filtered)
03_kallisto_quant: pseudoaligenment is run on all files with paried end (except sample 4 which is run with single end due to missing reverese read)
04_seq_depth: From abundance files, the sequencing depth is accessed for each sample. This is just a QC step.
05_tx2gene: From GTF file the the tx2gene (transcript to gene) file is made in R.
06_bulkAnalysis: Bulk analysis using DESeq2. Each folder have its own README.
