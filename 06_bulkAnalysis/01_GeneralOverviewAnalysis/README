1. General Overview Analysis (All Genes)

Purpose: Get a global view of how the samples relate to each other and identify major transcriptomic differences.
Analyses & Comparisons:

1.	Quality control
o	Check sequencing depth, mapping rates, gene counts per sample.✅ (MultiQC rapport)
o	Assess batch effects (Batch 1 vs Batch 2). (See in PCA)

2.	Global expression patterns
o	PCA using all expressed genes.✅
o	Hierarchical clustering/dendrogram.✅

3.	Differential expression
o	For each cytokine condition vs Control (within each donor, then combined across donors if appropriate).✅
# HW: within each donor does not make sense since you are comparing 1 against 1 and then you have no dispersion. ✅
o	For combined cytokine stimulations vs their respective single cytokines (to assess synergy).

4.	Top DEGs
o	Identify top 50 upregulated and top 50 downregulated genes for each comparison.✅

Figures:
•	PCA plot (color by condition, shape by donor).✅
•	Sample-to-sample correlation heatmap.✅
•	Heatmap of top 50 DEGs for selected comparisons.✅
•	Volcano plots for each comparison.✅
•	Barplots of number of DEGs per comparison (up vs down).✅
