Purpose: Specifically test whether combined cytokines produce unique expression changes beyond single cytokines.

Comparisons of interest:
•	IFNγ + IL17A vs IFNγ and vs IL17A.
•	IFNγ + TNFα vs IFNγ and vs TNFα.
•	TNFα + IL17A vs TNFα and vs IL17A.
•	IFNγ + TNFα + IL17A vs each single cytokine and vs each pair.

Figures:
•	Venn diagrams of DEGs between single and combined stimulations.
•	Heatmaps of synergy-specific genes.
•	Clustered heatmap showing expression patterns across all conditions.
