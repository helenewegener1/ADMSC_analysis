3. Immunomodulatory Gene Signature Focus

Purpose: Zoom in on genes related to immunomodulation (key for therapeutic potential).
Steps:
1.	Provide list of known immunomodulatory genes. 
2.	From DEGs, extract which immunomodulatory genes are significantly upregulated in each condition vs Control.
3.	Compare patterns of immunomodulatory gene activation between single and combined cytokine stimulations.

Figures:
•	Heatmap of immunomodulatory gene expression across all samples.
•	Dot plot or boxplot of selected key genes showing per-condition expression levels.
•	Barplot of number of immunomodulatory genes significantly upregulated per condition.
